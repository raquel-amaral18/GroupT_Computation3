<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How to Play

#### Singleplayer mode:
- Use arrow keys keys to move your car in the desired direction.
- Other cars will be coming towards you from the opposite direction. To survive, you have to avoid colliding with them.
- Aside from cars, you might come across **coins** or **power-ups** as well. The more coins you collect, the higher your score will be. Collecting power-ups will grant you a **temporary** advantage.
- Only **1** power-up can be active at a time, so choose wisely.

#### Multiplayer mode:
In this mode, players have two exciting options to choose from:
1. **Single Road:**
   - **Player 1:** Use arrow keys to control your car. 
   - **Player 2:** Use 'WASD' keys to navigate your car.
   - Race against each other on a single highway, avoiding collisions and competing for survival.
   - Collect 10 coins and earn yourself an extra life.
   - Remember, **you can't overlap**, so strategic maneuvering is key.
   - No power-ups are available in this mode, making it a pure test of skill.

2. **Double Road:**
   - **Player 1:** Use arrow keys for your right highway.
   - **Player 2:** Use 'WASD' keys for your left highway.
   - Engage in a thrilling race where the goal is to outlast your opponent. In case one of the players crash, the other will be able to continue playing. The main goal will be to **survive longer** than the other player.
   - Two separate highways present different obstacles and opportunities for each player.
   - Use power-ups strategically, keeping in mind that only one power-up can be active at a time.
   - Each player starts with 3 lives, and the one who survives the longest emerges victorious.

Invite a friend to play with you, and let the race begin! Will you be the ultimate champion of the roads?
