This is an example of how you can get a local copy of the game and run it on your computer

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)


### Installation

Please note that these instructions are tailored for Windows users. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to adapt the steps accordingly.

1. **Install Anaconda:**
   - Download and install Anaconda from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open Anaconda Prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/raquel-amaral18/GroupT_Computation3.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository:**
   - Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd GroupT_Computation3
     ```

4. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a new virtual environment (replace `your_environment_name` with your desired name):
     ```bash
     conda create --name your_environment_name python=3.8
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     conda activate your_environment_name
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install Pygame:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```

6. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the game using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How to Play

#### Singleplayer mode:
- Use **arrow keys** to move your car in the desired direction.
- Other cars will be coming towards you from the opposite direction. To survive, you have to avoid colliding with them.
- Collect **power-ups** for temporary advantages. You can hold up to two power-ups at a time. However, if the second power-up is different from the first, it will remain stored until you decide to use it. To use stored power-ups press **'Shift' (right)**.
- You will also come across **coins**, which, if registered with a username, can be used to purchase cars from the store.
- Bought cars will appear in your inventory, allowing you to select your preferred vehicle for gameplay. 


#### Multiplayer mode:
In this mode, players have two options to choose from:
1. **Single Road:**
   - **Player 1:** Use arrow keys to control your car. 
   - **Player 2:** Use 'WASD' keys to navigate your car.
   - Race against each other on a single highway, avoiding collisions and competing for survival.
   - Collect 10 coins and earn yourself an extra life.
   - Remember, **you can't overlap**, so strategic maneuvering is key.
   - No power-ups are available in this mode, making it a pure test of skill.

2. **Double Road:**
   - **Player 1:** Use arrow keys for your right highway.
   - **Player 2:** Use 'WASD' keys for your left highway.
   - The main goal will be to **survive longer** than the other player.
   - Each road presents different obstacles and opportunities for each player.
   - In this mode powerUps offer additional abilities when 'good' or impose temporary conditions on the opponent when 'bad'. 
   - Each player can hold up to two power-ups at a time. However, if the second power-up is different from the first, it will remain stored until you decide to use it. To use stored power-ups press **'Shift' (right)** if you are **Player 1** and **'Shift' (left)** if you are **Player 2**.

  Invite a friend to play with you, and let the race begin! Will you be the ultimate champion of the roads?
